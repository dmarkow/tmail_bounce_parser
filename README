TmailBounceParser
=================

This is based on Recipe 70 of Rails Recipes: "Handling Bounced Email". It has been updated 
to include implementations for non-standard servers that don't include the message/delivery-status 
and message/rfc822 parts.

Example
=======

message = TMail::Mail.parse(STDIN)
undeliverable_info = message.undeliverable_info

undeliverable_info.original_sender
# => "user@example.com"

undeliverable_info.message_id
# => "1242351jfsh235j523j@ggds.sa"

undeliverable_info.status
# => "Failure"
